# My Security Researcher Path

 Hey y'all! This has been my Path as a Security Researcher so far.

 The intention of this repo is to make this journey more fun and to keep track of my progress. Also, I hope this can be useful for someone else who is starting in this field.

 Any feedback is welcome! You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FerrerasManuel).
