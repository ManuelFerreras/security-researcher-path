# My Security Researcher Path

 Hey y'all! This has been my Path as a Security Researcher so far.

 The intention of this repo is to make this journey more fun and to keep track of my progress. Also, I hope this can be useful for someone else who is starting in this field.

 Any feedback is welcome! You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FerrerasManuel).

## <u>My Journey</u>

#### <u>Nov. 11, 2023</u>

- Attended "La Bitconf" in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
<br>

- I met [Carlos](https://twitter.com/carlitox477), who introduced me to Blockchain Security and Smart Contract Auditing. He gave me a brief introduction and some guidance on how I could start learning about it.
<br>

#### <u>Nov. 15, 2023</u>

- Created my first [post](https://twitter.com/FerrerasManuel/status/1724933936067793244) announcing the begining of the journey.
<br>

- Created a [roadmap in notion](https://manuelferreras.notion.site/Smart-Contracts-Audit-Roadmap-33509c4f359542dfb8ad720b46b200b7?pvs=4) to get to be a Security Researcher.
<br>

#### <u>Nov. 22, 2023</u>

- Started learning about Blockchain Security and Smart Contract Auditing, starting with [Owen's Thurm security course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRZogmD647U&t=2s).
<br>

#### <u>Nov. 26, 2023</u>

- After diving into the most of Owen's video and having in mind some consideration, I've made my first [audit](https://www.codehawks.com/contests/clnuo221v0001l50aomgo4nyn) on CodeHawks. Found 2 vulnerabilities which are described [here](https://github.com/ManuelFerreras/security-researcher-path/blob/main/Audits/CodeHawks/First%20Flights/First%20Flights%20%231%3A%20PasswordStore/audit.md).
<br>

- Also I've gone through the First Flight #2 code base and marked some important things in the code.
<br>

- I'm still with the First Part of the 2 videos course.
